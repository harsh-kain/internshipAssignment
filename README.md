# React Project Starter with Vite

This repository serves as a starter template for creating React projects with Vite. Vite is a fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development process by providing near-instantaneous cold server start and hot module replacement (HMR).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Node.js: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm (Node Package Manager): This comes bundled with Node.js installation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-starter.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd react-vite-starter
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will start the Vite development server and open your default web browser to the development environment. Any changes made to your React components will be hot-reloaded in the browser.

5. **Build for production:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will build your React project for production. The optimized output will be available in the `dist` directory.
